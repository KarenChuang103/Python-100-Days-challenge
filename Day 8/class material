# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.

def greet():
    a = input("How old are you?")
    b = input("How old is your sister?")
    print(int(b) + int(a))
    
greet()


# Function that allows for input
def greet_with_name(name):
    print(f'Hello {name}')
    print(f'How do you do {name}?')

greet_with_name('Karen')

# Funtions with more than 1 input
def greet_with(name, location):
    print(f'Hello {name}')
    print(f'What is it like in {location}')

greet_with("Karen", "LA")

# Functions with keyword argument

greet_with(name = "Karen", location = "LA")
